Passenger and route planning was made for the service vehicles coming from Kocaeli, a city in Turkey,'s districts to Kocaeli University. In this system, which is operated by taking requests from the passengers, dynamic route planning is made for the passengers. It is possible to create the most optimum routes by combining the information on the number of certain vehicles and stops with the information on the number of passengers at the stops. While doing this, road-cost optimization is made by calculating the rental cost and fuel consumption of the vehicles. 
<br><br>
There is a management and user panel in the mobile application. On the user panel, the person who will travel can choose the stop they will get on. The entry of unidentified information is not allowed. New stop information can be added via the management panel. Route planning is done in the admin panel. While planning the route, the number of passengers to board the next day and the stop information are used. After the route planning is made, the route information of the vehicle to be boarded is shown to the users. Access to the route information of different vehicles is blocked. Route information of all vehicles is displayed on the map in the admin panel. The route is planned as a route drawing algorithm.
